# DeepL Translation for Chrome
 This Chrome extension (which can be loaded locally) translates via context menu with the right mouse button your textarea or input fields e.g. in your CMS editor like WordPress or Kirby CMS in a very simple way.
 
 In the extension settings you can enter your Free or Pro API key from DeepL and select your preferred languages.
 
 After a refresh of the extension you can use the translation tools for your text selection by right clicking in Chrome.
